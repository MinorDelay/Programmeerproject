### Introduction
[A washed up pilot whale](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2018/06/03/in-thailand-aangespoelde-griend-dood-na-eten-8-kilo-plastic-a1605231)
covered the headlines of last weekend's newspapers. This particular whale had eaten 8 kilos of plastic, died, and was then washed up on a
beach in Thailand. Even though steps are being taken to [reduce the amount of plastic produced and thrown away](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2018/05/28/rietjes-mogen-niet-meer-maar-dat-microplastic-in-je-scrub-wel-a1604504),
it may already be too late for several other living animals in the seas and freshwater areas in the world. Raising awareness to this
problem may lead to the preservation of the biodiversity in our freshwaters and oceans.

### Visualizations
Using a world map I will visualize the amount of endangered fish species per country via a bar chart. It will be possible to switch from
the total amount of endangered fish to the amount of endangered marine fish or the amount of endangered freshwater fish for said country.
This bar chart will be combined with a line graph showing the threatened species as % of the known species in that particular country.

(This visualization is already possible due to the data from the following dataset: https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=WILD_LIFE#)
