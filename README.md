### Introduction
[A washed up pilot whale](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2018/06/03/in-thailand-aangespoelde-griend-dood-na-eten-8-kilo-plastic-a1605231)
covered the headlines of last weekend's newspapers. This particular whale had eaten 8 kilos of plastic, died, and was then washed up on a
beach in Thailand. Even though steps are being taken to [reduce the amount of plastic produced and thrown away](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2018/05/28/rietjes-mogen-niet-meer-maar-dat-microplastic-in-je-scrub-wel-a1604504),
it may already be too late for several other living animals in the seas and freshwater areas in the world. Raising awareness to this
problem may lead to the preservation of the biodiversity in our freshwaters and oceans.

### Visualizations
Using a world map I will visualize the amount of endangered fish species per country via a bar chart. It will be possible to switch from
the total amount of endangered fish to the amount of endangered marine fish or the amount of endangered freshwater fish for said country.
This bar chart will be combined with a line graph showing the threatened species as % of the known species in that particular country.

(This visualization is already possible due to the data from the following [dataset](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=WILD_LIFE#))

Whether these fish become endangered via pollution of the water, overfishing or any other feasible explanation is why there will be a
third visualization. This should easily provide some insight in what causes the fish to become endangered, and if we humans have any
hand in these fish becoming nearly extinct.
(This visualization is not yet possible due to not having found such a dataset. However adding this dataset will be a job for the coming
days.)

### Main features
- Using a world map to visualize which countries have endangered fish species.
- Visualize several variables as to how pressing the matter of these endangered species are and what causes these species to be
endangered.

### Datasources
- [Fishdata](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=WILD_LIFE#)
- Data that still has to be found.

### External components
- D3 functionalities
- TopoJSON

### Hardest part
- Making sure that the visualizations and the way I want to depict these are complicated enough.
