# Eindproject - something Fisy
Simon Kemmere - 10798250

The goal of this project was to visualise the plastic production in as many countries as possible. Clicking on countries
will guide the user through a bar chart and a pie chart containing data on how threatened the marine and freshwater fishspecies are
in that country. Following these visualisations, a solution is presented on another worldmap, showing harbours in Europe whom have
collected plastic from the oceans.

# The site

The top of the site shows information about the subject, explaining how the site come to this endproduct.
Also explaining how the variables are visualised and why these variables are chosen.

Next up there's the worldmap visualising how much plastic countries produce. The legend explains how the coloring in the map itself
work. Also there's a tooltip showing which country is hovered over en how much plastic they produce. If a cuontry has no data
concerning the production of plastic, the tooltip will return unknown regarding this production.

This picture shows how its possible for the user to zoom in on the map.

In this shot the charts that when clicking upon a country will update.

Regarding the solution of the problem an extra worldmap has been drawn, yet this map has different data then the one the user has
encountered the first time. In this map the user can see how much plastic is extracted from the oceans and by which harbours.

This map too is zoom and draggable. An extra feature concerning this map is that the data shown, can be updated via the dropdown button
on the righthand side of the map.
