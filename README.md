[A washed up pilot whale](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2018/06/03/in-thailand-aangespoelde-griend-dood-na-eten-8-kilo-plastic-a1605231) covered the headlines of last
weekend's newspapers. This particular whale had eaten 8 kilos of plastic, died, and was then washed up on a beach in Thailand. Even though steps are being taken to [reduce the
amount of plastic produced and thrown away](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2018/05/28/rietjes-mogen-niet-meer-maar-dat-microplastic-in-je-scrub-wel-a1604504), it may already be too
late for several other living animals in the seas and freshwater areas in the world. Therefore using a worldmap I will visualize the amount of endangered fish species per
country via a barchart. It will be possible to switch from the total amount of endangered fish to the amount of endangered marine fish or the amount of endangered freshwater
fish for said country.
