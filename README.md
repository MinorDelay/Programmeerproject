### Introduction
[A washed up pilot whale](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2018/06/03/in-thailand-aangespoelde-griend-dood-na-eten-8-kilo-plastic-a1605231)
covered the headlines of last weekend's newspapers. This particular whale had eaten 8 kilos of plastic, died, and was then washed up on a
beach in Thailand. Even though steps are being taken to [reduce the amount of plastic produced and thrown away](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2018/05/28/rietjes-mogen-niet-meer-maar-dat-microplastic-in-je-scrub-wel-a1604504),
it may already be too late for several other living animals in the seas and freshwater areas in the world. Raising awareness to this
problem may lead to the preservation of the biodiversity in our freshwaters and oceans.

### Visualizations
Using a world map I will visualize the amount of plastic a country produces (in tonnes). Then after clicking on a country the 
amount of endangered fish species for that country will be displayed via a bar chart. Using a button the user will be
able to switch to a pie chart showing the threatened species as % of the known species in that particular country.
Ofcourse the user will then be able to be directed to the bar chart again using the button below the aforementioned button.

When there's enough time I'd like to add another world map that can show over the years (2014-2016) what ports (harbours) do about the
plastic waste in the oceans. TThe change over the years will be visualized via a slider. (The data from 2014 for this particular
visualization can be found [here](https://github.com/MinorDelay/Programmeerproject/blob/master/Something_fishy/data/ospar_fishing_litter_2014_01-other-OSPAR_Fishing_for_Litter_2014.xls).

### Main features
- Using a world map to visualize which countries have endangered fish species.
- Visualize several variables to show how pressing the matter of these endangered species are and what is done about the plastic
pollution in the ocean.

### Datasources
- [Fishdata](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=WILD_LIFE#)
- [Plasticdata](https://github.com/MinorDelay/Programmeerproject/blob/master/Something_fishy/data/UNEP-CHW-NREP-COMPI-2011-TotalsGeneratedHW.English.pdf)

### External components
- D3 functionalities
- TopoJSON
- tooltip

### Hardest part
- Making sure that the visualizations and the way I want to depict these are complicated enough.
