## Wednesday 6-6-18 / Day 1
- Had our first meeting. Was useful and had a nice introduction with my group.
- Yesterday my project proposal was accepted, it will be in the format as described below.

1. Worldmap where countries are colored, the color represents the amount of plastic that was produced in tonnes in 2010.
2. When clicked on a country a bar chart will appear beside the map where the absolute numbers of endangered fish (total)/marine fish/
sweetwater fish will be presented. Bar chart will change when a different country is clicked.
3. At the side of this bar chart will be a button, that when clicked upon will show a pie chart representing the threatened species as % 
of known species, thus being a interactive html element.
4. Under the worldmap will be a searchbox where data from countries can be searched directly. That means you won't need to search the 
country on the map if you need to see it's data.
5. If there's still time left I'd like to add another element that will show a dot on the map representing a port (harbour). This dot
will represent the amount of plastic in tonnage that this port in 2014 has extracted from the sea. The bigger the dot, the more
plastic was extracted from the ocean. If there's more time I'd like to add a slider that let's the user switch the year and thus the data.

- Today's goal is to make a design document clearly explaining the way I want to handle the abovementioned ideas.

## Thursday 7-6-18 / Day 2
- Updated the readme after the commentary on my proposal.
- Made the data I have accessible in csv format. Now I only need to jsonify it and then I can work with my data.
This will be a job for tomorrow.
- There will be a presentation for tomorrow. My group is at 11. So if there will be extra information online by the time it's 9 AM
tomorrow I can do some preparations.
